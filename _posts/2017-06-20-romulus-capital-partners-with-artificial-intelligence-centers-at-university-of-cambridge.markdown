Romulus Capital, a seed-stage venture capital fund focused on investing in and building technology businesses, today announces its support for the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (CFI) and the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER) at the University of Cambridge.

CFI, which opened late this year, was launched to explore both the opportunities and the challenges that humans will face as they continue to develop artificial intelligence more prominently and elegantly. A £10 million grant from the Leverhulme Trust allows global thought leaders in computer science, philosophy, and social science to collaborate on their examinations of the ethical questions raised by the development of artificial intelligence. CSER is a multidisciplinary center dedicated to to the study and mitigation of risks that could lead to human extinction. As Huw Price, Fellow of Trinity College at Cambridge and Academic Director of both centers, notes, “Machine intelligence will be one of the defining themes of our century, and the challenges of ensuring that we make good use of its opportunities are ones we all face together.”

Romulus Capital, which is an active investor in companies developing novel applications of artificial intelligence, expresses its full support for both centers and their missions. “Romulus was founded to help build large and impactful entities, and machine intelligence will be seminal to both existing and nascent entities if they wish to stand the test of time. The questions of how humanity itself transforms, and indeed is transformed by, this progress in machine intelligence are critical ones that we must explore together across disciplines as entrepreneurs, investors, engineers, scientists, philosophers, and so on, if we are to prevent the end of our fragile world. Cambridge is doing humanity a great service by cultivating these two centers.”    

In recent years, Romulus has made significant investments in companies utilizing artificial intelligence to effect positive change in the world. Three such companies out of MIT include Ginger.io, which allows mental health professionals to track their patients’ moods and behavior; Humanyze, which uses data and analytics to create happier, more productive office environments; and Cogito, which analyzes data embedded in voices and tones to help call centers and other organizations practice empathy.

As it continues to make strategic investments in companies using artificial intelligence to improve the human condition, Romulus congratulates CFI and CSER on their pioneering work and plans to collaborate through dialogue and joint projects in early 2017.
