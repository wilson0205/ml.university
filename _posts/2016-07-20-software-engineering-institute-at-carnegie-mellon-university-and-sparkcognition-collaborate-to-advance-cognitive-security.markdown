The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University is collaborating with industry-leading Cognitive Security Analytics company, SparkCognition, to build an automated cognitive cyber security threat remediation tool using SparkCognition’s proprietary technology and IBM Watson.

As part of the collaboration, engineers at SparkCognition will train the research team at the SEI’s CERT Division on how to use IBM Watson to catalogue and make query-able vulnerabilities on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list and CERT Secure Coding Rules. SparkCognition has already trained IBM Watson on a very large corpus of cybersecurity technical literature, including the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list, OWASP literature, and many more cyber security databases.
“As software has become essential to all aspects of system capabilities and operations, there has been a dramatic increase in the significance of cybersecurity,” said Mark Sherman, Technical Director for Cyber Security Foundations at the SEI. “The CERT Division focuses its research on cybersecurity challenges in national security, homeland security, and critical infrastructure protection. We seek to develop and broadly transition new technologies, tools, and practices that enable informed trust and confidence in using information and communication technology. SparkCognition provides critical capabilities for this advanced initiative.”

SparkCognition’s technology is capable of harnessing real time infrastructure data and learning from it continuously, allowing for more accurate risk mitigation and prevention policies to intervene and avert disasters. The company’s cybersecurity centered solution analyzes structured and unstructured data and natural language sources to identify potential cyber threats. The uniqueness of the cognitive platform is resonated by the fact that it can continuously learn from data and derive automated insights to thwart any emerging issue.

“We are looking forward to working with one of the nation’s leading cybersecurity programs,” said Keith Moore, Product Manager of SparkCognition. “The company is building solutions that address cyber risk and resilience, software vulnerability, insider threat, secure coding practices, and other areas. Together, we are leading in new approaches, analysis tools, and training options to improve the practice of cybersecurity in private and public sector organizations, and we’re excited to collaborate with the SEI in pursuit of that mission.”
